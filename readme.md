# Introduction 
This write-up summarizes my research focused on Microsoft Intune’s Windows enrollment flow. The goal was to understand how enrollment state is established, which server-side validations actually gate enrollment and where client-provided context can influence outcomes.

The work sits in the context of my internship at Bureau Veritas Cybersecurity for Fontys University of Applied Sciences.
